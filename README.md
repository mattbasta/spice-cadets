# Spice Cadets

Spice Cadets is a video game I've worked on briefly on-and-off since college.
It's a third-person sandbox: you play as a bottle of spice, stealing the spices
of others to disguise yourself in order to survive for as long as possible. You
must survive for as long as possible, taking care to eat and sleep.

Currently, this game is in a poor state as its only recent development has been
while on airplanes or under the influence.
